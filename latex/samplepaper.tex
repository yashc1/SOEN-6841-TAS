\section{Background Material}

\subsection{Self-Awareness in Project Management}
Schock-Smith emphasizes that self-awareness is the bedrock of effective project management \cite{ref_9}. Project managers need to introspect, understand their behavioral tendencies, preferences, and emotional responses in diverse scenarios. This awareness enables them to recognize their strengths, acknowledge their limitations, and adapt their leadership styles accordingly. It empowers project managers to make informed decisions, communicate more effectively, and navigate conflicts within their teams. Moreover, self-awareness aids in stress management and resilience, pivotal qualities for leading teams in high-pressure project environments.

\subsection{Team Dynamics and Collaboration}
The article underscores the critical role of fostering robust team dynamics and cultivating collaborative environments \cite{ref_10}. Understanding the intricacies of team members' personalities, skill sets, and work preferences enables project managers to build a cohesive team culture. Schock-Smith advocates for a team ethos grounded in trust, open communication, and shared objectives. Such an environment encourages the exchange of ideas, harnesses collective intelligence, and promotes innovative problem-solving. Effective collaboration within teams not only enhances productivity but also instills a sense of ownership and accountability among team members, fostering a conducive environment for project success.

\subsection{Personality Type Differences in Project Management}
Understanding personality type differences among team members is an underlying factor in effective project management. Acknowledging diverse personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and communication styles is instrumental in fostering a cohesive team environment. Insights from personality typologies, such as Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) \cite{REF_7} or other similar models, provide valuable perspectives on how varying personalities contribute to team dynamics and interactions within project teams.

Recognizing these differences allows project managers to navigate team interactions, tailor communication strategies, and strategically form partnerships that leverage diverse strengths. Integrating insights from personality typologies aligns with the article's emphasis on self-awareness, team dynamics, and the creation of complementary partnerships within project teams. Understanding and capitalizing on personality differences contribute to the overall effectiveness and harmony within project management contexts.

\section{Results Obtained}
\subsection{Self-Awareness Dynamics for Effective Project Management}
In resonance with Angyne J. Schock-Smith's exploration of project management dynamics, a comprehensive study~\cite{ref_4} endeavored to conceptualize the dimensions of self-awareness within the specific context of leader development. Much like Schock-Smith's emphasis on understanding one's strengths and weaknesses for effective project management, the study aimed to delineate facets of self-awareness crucial for proficient leadership in project management scenarios.

The study postulated four fundamental dimensions of self-awareness critical for effective leadership. These dimensions encompassed:

\textbf{Recognition of Standards:} An exploration into internal and external standards.

\textbf{Awareness of Attributes:} Understanding one's positive and negative attributes and abilities.

\textbf{Introspection and Self-reflection:} A desire for introspective thought and self-reflection.

\textbf{Detecting Gaps:} The capacity to accurately identify gaps in personal behaviors and goal progress.

To create a robust self-awareness scale, the study meticulously constructed a comprehensive inventory derived from inputs by I/O psychology experts, resulting in a final draft of 71 items. This process paralleled Schock-Smith's advocacy for utilizing various personality tests and evaluations for self-assessment.

However, the study's empirical findings revealed a nuanced perspective. Through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the four-factor solution accounted for 27\% of the total variance. Notably, the empirical dimensionality displayed a slight deviation from the anticipated theoretical model, uncovering an unexpected dimension related to an indifference toward external cues in self-awareness processes.

Correlations between the present self-awareness scale and existing measures of self-awareness, cognitive, and affective constructs were established, ranging from moderate (0.37 to 0.57). These correlations supported the cognitive-emotional nature of self-awareness processes, resonating with Schock-Smith's emphasis on the interplay between personal attributes and team dynamics.

However, akin to Schock-Smith's divergence between theoretical ideals and practical applicability, the study's findings highlighted a potential gap between the proposed theoretical model and empirical dimensionality, suggesting the need for further refinement. This echoes Schock-Smith's call for adaptability and continuous learning within project management approaches.

In essence, while both Schock-Smith's article and the study navigated the landscape of self-awareness and collaboration in distinct contexts, they converge on the theme of understanding individual capabilities. They underscore the need for continuous refinement and adaptation to achieve optimal effectiveness within respective domains, serving as a guiding beacon for both project managers and leaders striving for excellence.

\subsection{Team Dynamics and Collaboration}
Gelbard and Carmeli's research \cite{ref_5} delving into team dynamics and organizational support within ICT projects, involving 191 ICT project managers associated with the Project Management Institute (PMI), shares thematic similarities with Schock-Smith's exploration of project management dynamics. Both studies converge on the pivotal role of collaborative teamwork and the vital backing of organizations in steering projects towards successful outcomes.

Schock-Smith, emphasizing the team-oriented approach over individual heroism in project management, closely aligns with Gelbard and Carmeli's findings. The latter's study underscores the significance of team dynamics marked by communication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, establishing a robust association between heightened team dynamics and improved budgetary, time, and functionality performance in ICT projects, resonating with Schock-Smith's collaborative project management paradigm.

Furthermore, the fundamental importance of organizational support echoed in both studies underscores the necessity of a conducive environment. Schock-Smith advocates for a supportive organizational culture providing crucial resources and guidance, mirroring Gelbard and Carmeli's emphasis on organizational support as a pivotal factor enabling the success of team dynamics in ICT projects. Gelbard and Carmeli stress the importance of both behavioral and technical support from the organization, akin to the significance of a supportive organizational culture highlighted by Schock-Smith.

The multifaceted nature of project success resonates across both studies. Schock-Smith proposes a holistic perspective, encompassing qualitative aspects such as customer satisfaction and overall project value, while Gelbard and Carmeli identify two distinct yet interconnected facets of ICT project performance—budgetary and time performance, and functionality performance. This aligns with Schock-Smith's comprehensive view of project success, highlighting the various dimensions contributing to overall project excellence.

Moving forward, both studies advocate for further exploration. Schock-Smith encourages investigations into collaborative practices and leadership styles contributing to successful project outcomes, while Gelbard and Carmeli suggest exploring the emergence of positive team dynamics and determining optimal support across various project stages. Methodological limitations noted by both articles underscore the need for future studies to address these gaps and employ more comprehensive research methodologies.

In summary, Gelbard and Carmeli's meticulous study on ICT project success underscores the critical role of cohesive team dynamics within a supportive organizational context, paralleling Schock-Smith's emphasis on the collective efforts of teams and the significance of a supportive organizational culture in effective project management.

\subsection{Results Based on Personality Type Data Analysis}
According to a study \cite{ref_6} ,The aggregation of personality type data from diverse sources into a unified repository represents a significant milestone, consolidating statistics on population preferences, temperament, and type table data.

Contrary to previous assertions, recent findings reveal a shift in extroversion distribution, indicating that the US population comprises 49\% extroverts, whereas the UK exhibits a slightly higher extroversion rate of 53\%. Interestingly, other personality traits between these populations display remarkable similarities.

The study emphasizes the efficacy of methods (e.g., MBTI, Keirsey, Belbin, or Learning Styles) grouping teams based on underlying personality traits. Notably, CitationWilde's method, incorporating adapted MBTI and KTS II techniques at Stanford University, significantly impacted awards, achieving a 73\% success rate in the National Lincoln Prize awards.

However, practical implementation poses challenges due to resource constraints. For the average lecturer, the limitations in time and finances hinder extensive adoption of these methods. Consequently, the need arises either for a shift in the philosophy of team selection or the exploration of cost-effective alternatives.

Efforts to address these constraints involve experimentation with freely available pseudo-MBTI questionnaires, like CitationSimilarminds' questionnaire. However, the compromise in reliability and validity prompts the necessity for additional empirical studies.

While historical research dates back to the 1950s-1970s, ongoing efforts by agencies such as CAPT, CPP Inc, and the OPP Ltd rejuvenate and supplement outdated datasets.

Highlighting disparities between the Chinese and Western populations, significant differences emerge in personality preferences. Chinese populations exhibit stronger preferences for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Judging traits, providing valuable insights for educational and business contexts.

Analyzing MBTI personality types for engineering and design fields identifies eight types best suited to engineering design. Educators and leaders can construct successful engineering design teams, with ISTJ or ESTJ leadership, leveraging complementary skills.

The study's conclusion advocates for the incorporation of type theory in engineering team selection, potentially benefiting the engineering education community and industrial sectors alike.
